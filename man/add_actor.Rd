\title{Add an actor line to a actor nodelist data frame}
\usage{
add_actor(
  nodelist,
  name,
  dicts = "usfullsurveyor2015",
  dict_stat = "mean",
  dict_gender = "av",
  dict_file_prefix = "dict",

  eqns_gender = c("av", "female"),
  alphas = NA,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodelist}{a data frame to add the actor line to}

\item{name}{a string to use as the actor's name}

\item{dicts}{one of several options (see Details):
\itemize{
\item 1a: A dictionary key from actdata. Data is pulled from that package and split into
the four required components based on the component column.
\item 1b: A list of four dictionary keys from actdata to be used for, in order, own identities,
behaviors, partner identities, and emotions. The same key may be used for more than one
category.
\item 2a: An EPA data frame with a "component" column that is used to split it into
a list of length 4 following the above order.
\item 2b: A list of four EPA data frames in order: own identities, behaviors, partner
identities, emotions. Use "list()", rather than "c()", to construct this list.
\item 3: A list of four file paths to csv files containing the required dictionaries.
}}

\item{dict_stat}{string or string list length 4: stat of provided dictionaries (mean,
cov, sd). For data sets in actdata, check available stats with \code{\link[actdata:dict_info]{actdata::dict_info()}}.}

\item{dict_gender}{string or string list length 4: gender of provided dictionaries (av,
female, male). For data sets in actdata, check available genders with \code{\link[actdata:dict_info]{actdata::dict_info()}}.}

\item{dict_file_prefix}{prefix to append to dictionary data files that
are written out. Default is "dict."}

\item{eqns}{string or string list length 2 providing equations to use. See Details. Entries must either by
equation keys from the actdata package or valid filepaths to coefficient matrices. If
provided as a length 2 list, the first entry is used as the impression ABO coefficients and
the second as the emotion coefficients. If a single entry (only possible for coefficients in
actdata), the function attempts to find these two components itself.}

\item{eqns_gender}{string or string list length 2: gender of equations to use (av, female,
male). For datasets in actdata, check available genders with \code{\link[actdata:eqn_info]{actdata::eqn_info()}}. An error
is thrown if the specified equation set is not available for the specified gender.}

\item{alphas}{numeric or numeric list length 3: alpha value(s) to use. See Details.}

\item{betas}{numeric or numeric list length 2: beta value(s) to use. See Details.}

\item{deltas}{numeric or numeric list length 2: delta value(s) to use. See Details.}

\item{numsamples}{numeric: number of samples to be used by the actor for each interaction.
Default is 1000.}

provided nodelist with actor line appended

\description{
The nodelist is a data frame that contains information for the actors in
a simulation, including names and EPA dictionaries and equations. Actors
also have optional parameters that control how they manage uncertainty in
interactions.
}
\section{Dictionaries and equations}{
Each actor needs four dictionaries representing:
\enumerate{
\item the EPA values for identities they assign to themselves
\item the EPA values they assign to behaviors that are valid within the interaction
\item the EPA values for identities they assign to their interaction partners
\item the EPA values they assign to modifiers and emotions.
}

They also need two sets of equation coefficients:
\enumerate{
\item Impression equation coefficients which determine ideal elements of A-B-O
(actor-behavior-object) events. In actdata, these are referred to with the
"impressionabo" keyword.
\item Emotion equation coefficients which estimate emotional reactions to events.
In actdata, these are referred to with the "emotionid" keyword.
}

These dictionaries and equations can be provided in one of three ways (mixing and matching is allowed):
\itemize{
\item If you are working with publicly available ACT sentiment dictionaries and equation
sets, dictionaries may be specified using keywords from the actdata package. This
package is a repository for standardized versions of many publicly available ACT
sentiment dictionaries and equation sets, and it and bayesactR were developed to
complement each other. If using dictionaries and/or equations from actdata, provide
the applicable keyword as the dict or eqns argument. To see information about available
data sets and gender subsets, see the package readme or call \code{\link[actdata:dict_info]{actdata::dict_info()}} or
\code{\link[actdata:eqn_info]{actdata::eqn_info()}}.
\item Dictionaries can also be provided as data frame objects. This is particularly useful
when you wish to use a subset of terms from a public dictionaryâ€“for example, perhaps
you only want your agents to be able to take a limited set of behaviors, or identities
from just one institution, rather than having access to the whole list. The
\code{\link[actdata:epa_subset]{actdata::epa_subset()}} function within actdata makes creating subsets from public
data straightforward.
\item If you have collected or estimated your own data or otherwise have access to non-public
data sets, you may provide a filepath to the dictionary and equation files in the
dict and eqns arguments. These must be properly formatted for BayesACT. When provided with
filepaths, bayesactR passes them directly to BayesACT with no formatting checks or changes.
See also \code{\link[actdata:format_for_bayesact]{actdata::format_for_bayesact()}}, which can help reformat datasets correctly.
}
}

\section{Parameters alpha, beta, and delta}{
There are three parameters that control how actors tend to respond to interactions. In
each case, these parameters can be set separately for the relevant elements of the situation
(actor, behavior, and client/object), or can be provided as a single number which is applied
across elements.

For more information on these parameters, see the \emph{BayesACT Version 2: Technical Users Manual},
available in the BayesACT C directory under the subdirectory \emph{bayesact/docs/}. The following is
a summary of description found there.
\itemize{
\item Alpha (a set of three values alpha_a, alpha_b, alpha_c) represents the strength of the affect
control principle (higher value is weaker; default is 0.1).
\item Beta (a set of two values beta_a and beta_c) represents identity sentiment inertia, or how
stable we expect EPA values for identities to remain over time. Default is 0.01.
\item Delta (a set of two values delta_a and delta_c) represents denotative identity stability, or
how likely it is that someone is relabeled. Default is 0.1.
}

If the actor is given optional arguments (alphas, betas, deltas, numsamples) that are not
already columns in the data frame, these columns will be added.
