#' Add an actor line to a actor nodelist data frame
#'
#' The nodelist is a data frame that contains information for the actors in
#' a simulation, including names and EPA dictionaries and equations. Actors
#' also have optional parameters that control how they manage uncertainty in
#' interactions.
#'
#'
#' # Dictionaries and equations
#'
#' Each actor needs four dictionaries representing:
#' 1. the EPA values for identities they assign to themselves
#' 2. the EPA values they assign to behaviors that are valid within the interaction
#' 3. the EPA values for identities they assign to their interaction partners
#' 4. the EPA values they assign to modifiers and emotions.
#'
#' They also need two sets of equation coefficients:
#' 1. Impression equation coefficients which determine ideal elements of A-B-O
#'     (actor-behavior-object) events. In actdata, these are referred to with the
#'     "impressionabo" keyword.
#' 2. Emotion equation coefficients which estimate emotional reactions to events.
#'    In actdata, these are referred to with the "emotionid" keyword.
#'
#' These dictionaries and equations can be provided in one of three ways (mixing and matching is allowed):
#' * If you are working with publicly available ACT sentiment dictionaries and equation
#'     sets, dictionaries may be specified using keywords from the actdata package. This
#'     package is a repository for standardized versions of many publicly available ACT
#'     sentiment dictionaries and equation sets, and it and bayesactR were developed to
#'     complement each other. If using dictionaries and/or equations from actdata, provide
#'     the applicable keyword as the dict or eqns argument. To see information about available
#'     data sets and gender subsets, see the package readme or call [actdata::dict_info()] or
#'     [actdata::eqn_info()].
#' * Dictionaries can also be provided as data frame objects. This is particularly useful
#'     when you wish to use a subset of terms from a public dictionaryâ€“for example, perhaps
#'     you only want your agents to be able to take a limited set of behaviors, or identities
#'     from just one institution, rather than having access to the whole list. The
#'     [actdata::epa_subset()] function within actdata makes creating subsets from public
#'     data straightforward.
#' * If you have collected or estimated your own data or otherwise have access to non-public
#'     data sets, you may provide a filepath to the dictionary and equation files in the
#'     dict and eqns arguments. These must be properly formatted for BayesACT. When provided with
#'     filepaths, bayesactR passes them directly to BayesACT with no formatting checks or changes.
#'     See also [actdata::format_for_bayesact()], which can help reformat datasets correctly.
#'
#' # Parameters alpha, beta, and delta
#'
#' There are three parameters that control how actors tend to respond to interactions. In
#' each case, these parameters can be set separately for the relevant elements of the situation
#' (actor, behavior, and client/object), or can be provided as a single number which is applied
#' across elements.
#'
#' For more information on these parameters, see the *BayesACT Version 2: Technical Users Manual*,
#' available in the BayesACT C directory under the subdirectory *bayesact/docs/*. The following is
#' a summary of description found there.
#'
#' * Alpha (a set of three values alpha_a, alpha_b, alpha_c) represents the strength of the affect
#'    control principle (higher value is weaker; default is 0.1).
#' * Beta (a set of two values beta_a and beta_c) represents identity sentiment inertia, or how
#'    stable we expect EPA values for identities to remain over time. Default is 0.01.
#' * Delta (a set of two values delta_a and delta_c) represents denotative identity stability, or
#'    how likely it is that someone is relabeled. Default is 0.1.
#'
#' If the actor is given optional arguments (alphas, betas, deltas, numsamples) that are not
#' already columns in the data frame, these columns will be added.
#'
#' @param nodelist a data frame to add the actor line to
#' @param name a string to use as the actor's name
#' @param dicts one of several options (see Details):
#'     1a. A dictionary key from actdata. Data is pulled from that package and split into
#'     the four required components based on the component column.
#'     1b. A list of four dictionary keys from actdata to be used for, in order, own identities,
#'     behaviors, partner identities, and emotions. The same key may be used for more than one
#'     category.
#'     2a. An EPA data frame with a "component" column that is used to split it into
#'     a list of length 4 following the above order.
#'     2b. A list of four EPA data frames in order: own identities, behaviors, partner
#'     identities, emotions. Use "list()", rather than "c()", to construct this list.
#'     3a. A list of four file paths to csv files containing the required dictionaries.
#' @param dict_stat string or string list length 4: stat of provided dictionaries (mean,
#'     cov, sd). For data sets in actdata, check available stats with [actdata::dict_info()].
#' @param dict_gender string or string list length 4: gender of provided dictionaries (av,
#'     female, male). For data sets in actdata, check available genders with [actdata::dict_info()].
#' @param dict_file_prefix prefix to append to dictionary data files that
#'     are written out. Default is "dict."
#' @param eqns string or string list length 2 providing equations to use. See Details. Entries must either by
#'     equation keys from the actdata package or valid filepaths to coefficient matrices. If
#'     provided as a length 2 list, the first entry is used as the impression ABO coefficients and
#'     the second as the emotion coefficients. If a single entry (only possible for coefficients in
#'     actdata), the function attempts to find these two components itself.
#' @param eqns_gender string or string list length 2: gender of equations to use (av, female,
#'     male). For datasets in actdata, check available genders with [actdata::eqn_info()]. An error
#'     is thrown if the specified equation set is not available for the specified gender.
#' @param alphas numeric or numeric list length 3: alpha value(s) to use. See Details.
#' @param betas numeric or numeric list length 2: beta value(s) to use. See Details.
#' @param deltas numeric or numeric list length 2: delta value(s) to use. See Details.
#' @param numsamples numeric: number of samples to be used by the actor for each interaction.
#'     Default is 1000.

#' Add an interaction line to the edgelist
#'
#' The edgelist is a data frame containing information on the relationships between
#' actors, including the identities they inhabit in interactions with one another and
#' the labels they ascribe to each other. This function adds a line, representing a directed
#' relationship between one actor and another, to an edgelist data frame created by
#' [blank_edgelist()].
#'
#' An edgelist line can be considered to define a relationship between two actors, an agent
#' and an object, in a simulation *from the perspective of the agent*. The agent has a label
#' (or multiple possible labels) for their own identity, and possible label(s) for
#' the object's identity. If a list of multiple identities are provided for either agent
#' or object, then the agent will randomly select one of the provided identities in each
#' simulation repetition. In this case, the selection probabilities are given by
#' agent_ident_prob and object_ident_prob.
#'
#' Because each edgelist line represents the situation from the perspective of just one
#' actor (the agent), each dyadic relationship in a simulation requires two edgelist lines:
#' one from the perspective of each actor. Actors might agree on their identities--for example, both
#' may agree that person 1 will act as a "sister" and person 2 will act as a "brother". In
#' this case the two edgelist lines will be mirror images of each other. Actors may also
#' begin interactions in disagreement about their identities--person 1 may see themselves as
#' a "sister" and see person 2 as a "brother," but person 2 may instead see person 1 as a "bully"
#' and themselves as a "victim."
#'
#' It is possible that person 1 knows person 2 but person 2 does not know person 1. In this case,
#' two edgelist lines are still required. However, the object_ident and object_ident_prob for
#' person 2 (representing their initial label for person 1) will be the empty string "".
#'
#' These identities are only starting points for a simulation. Identities may shift through the
#' course of an interaction and generally may take any value represented in the identity dictionaries
#' provided in the nodelist. If you wish to restrict the possible values, you may remove them
#' from the dictionary provided there, or use the optional "institution" argument in this function
#' to restrict to identities that only apply in particular social contexts.
#'
#' If an interaction is given optional arguments (institution, rseed) that are not already
#' columns in the provided dataframe, those columns are added.
#'
#' @param edgelist interaction edgelist to add to
#' @param agent string agent's name
#' @param object string object's name
#' @param agent_ident string or string list: agent's label(s) for their own identity at the
#'     outset of an interaction. If multiple are provided, the agent chooses one of them, and
#'     the probability of each being chosen is taken from the agent_ident_prob argument.
#'     Default is c("friend", "person").
#' @param agent_ident_prob numeric or numeric list summing to 1: probability of taking
#'     each identity in agent_ident. Default is c(.5, .5).
#' @param object_ident string or string list: agent's label(s) for object's identity at the
#'     outset of an interaction. If multiple are provided, the agent chooses one of them, and
#'     the probability of each being chosen is taken from the object_ident_prob argument.
#'     Default is c("friend", "person").
#' @param object_ident_prob numeric or numeric list summing to 1: probability of taking
#'     each identity in object_ident. Default is c(.5, .5).
#' @param institution string or string list: the institution(s) identities in this relationship
#'     can come from. Valid institutions are lay, business, law, politics, academe, medicine,
#'     religion, family, sexual, monadic, group, corporal, male, and female (see actdata for details).
#'     Default is NA, which allows all institutions.
