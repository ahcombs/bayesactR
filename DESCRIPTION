Description: This package provides utilities to facilitate running BayesACT simulations in a replicable way using R. It includes all publicly available dictionary and equation data, converted to a standard format. It includes functions to automate the production of BayesACT input text files so that running multiple simulations (perhaps to loop over identities, parameter settings, behaviors, etc) is easy.
